{\cf1\f1\fs22 1 }Now after the death of Moses the servant of the {\scaps Lord}, the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} \uc1\u8220*Moses my servant is dead. Come, cross the Jordan here, you and all this people, into the land which I assign to them, to the Israelites. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} Every foot of ground you tread I assign to you, as I promised Moses. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} Your frontier will stretch from the desert to Lebanon, from the great River, the river Euphrates, over all the land of the Hittites, to the great Mediterranean Sea westward. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} No one will be able to hold their own against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will never fail you nor forsake you. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} Be strong, be brave, for you will put this people in possession of the land which I swore to their ancestors that I would give them. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} Only be strong and brave, mindful to carry out all your orders from my servant Moses, turning neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} This book of the law you should never cease to have on your lips. You must pore over it day and night, that you may be mindful to carry out all that is written in it, for so will you make your way prosperous, so will you succeed. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} These are my orders: be firm and brave, never be daunted or dismayed, for the {\scaps Lord} your God is with you wherever you go.\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} Then Joshua ordered the officers of the nation {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} to go through the camp and command the people to \uc1\u8220*Prepare food, for within three days you are going to cross the Jordan here and enter into possession of the land which the {\scaps Lord} your God assigns you for your very own.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} Joshua also said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} \uc1\u8220*Remember what Moses the servant of the {\scaps Lord} commanded you when he told you that the {\scaps Lord} your God would settle you here and give you this region. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} Your wives, your children, and your cattle can remain in this land which Moses assigned you east of the Jordan, but you must march across under arms in front of your kinsmen, every fighting man among you, to assist them, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} until the {\scaps Lord} settles your kinsmen like yourselves, until they get possession of the land which the {\scaps Lord} your God assigns to them. Then you can return to your own region and occupy the land assigned you by Moses the servant of the {\scaps Lord} on the eastern bank of the Jordan.\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} They answered Joshua, \uc1\u8220*Whatever you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} As we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you. Only may the {\scaps Lord} your God be with you as he was with Moses! {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} Whoever rebels against your orders, and will not listen to what you say by way of command, will be put to death. Only be firm and brave.\uc1\u8221*

{\cf1\f1\fs22 2 }From Shittim Joshua sent two men secretly as spies to explore the country and especially Jericho. When they arrived they went into the house of a prostitute called Rahab and stayed there. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} The king of Jericho was told that two men of Israel had come in that night to find out about the country, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} so he sent a message to Rahab to \uc1\u8220*Bring out the two men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they are here to find out all about the country.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} The woman, who had taken the men and hid them, said, \uc1\u8220*Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they came from, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} and just about the hour for shutting the towngate, when it was dark, the men went off. Where they went, I do not know. Quick, pursue them, for you will overtake them.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} Now she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax which she had arranged on the roof. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} The pursuers went by the road to the Jordan, as far as the fords, and as soon as they left the town the gate was shut. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} The two men had not lain down before the woman came to them on the roof and said, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} \uc1\u8220*I know that the {\scaps Lord} has given you this country, and how the terror of you has fallen upon us, until all who live here are trembling before you. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} For we have heard how the {\scaps Lord} dried up the water of the Reed Sea before you when you left Egypt, and how you treated the two Amorite kings on the east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you wiped off the earth. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} As soon as we heard it, our hearts trembled and everyone became utterly dispirited because of you, for the {\scaps Lord} your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, pray swear to me by the {\scaps Lord} that you will deal kindly with my family, and give me a sure sign of it. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} Swear that you will spare the lives of my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and all they have, saving us from death.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} The men replied, \uc1\u8220*Our lives for yours \uc1\u8211* only you must not breathe a word about our errand. Then we will deal kindly and honestly with you when the {\scaps Lord} gives us the country.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} Then she lowered them by a rope out of the window, for her house was on the town wall. She stayed on the town wall. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} She told them, \uc1\u8220*Get away to the hills, lest the pursuers come across you. Hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return, and then make your way back.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} The men told her, \uc1\u8220*We will not be bound by this oath to you, which you have made us swear, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} unless, when we enter the country, you tie this cord of scarlet thread outside the window through which you let us down. You must gather your father and mother and brothers and all your family inside your house. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} Anyone who crosses the door of your house into the street, their blood be on their own head, we are not to blame. But if a hand is laid on anyone inside the house, then that person\uc1\u8217*s blood be on our head! {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} But remember, if you breathe a word about our errand, we will not be bound by the oath you have made us swear.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} \uc1\u8220*As you say,\uc1\u8221* answered the woman, \uc1\u8220*so be it.\uc1\u8221* So away they went, while she tied the scarlet cord to the window. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} They went into the hills and stayed there for three days, until the pursuers returned (the pursuers looked for them all along the road and could not find them). {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua the son of Nun, telling him all that had happend to them. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} They said to Joshua, \uc1\u8220*The {\scaps Lord} has put all the country into our hands. Everyone who lives in this land is trembling before us!\uc1\u8221*

{\cf1\f1\fs22 3 }In the morning Joshua rose, and he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and reached the Jordan, where they passed the night before they crossed over. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} Three days afterwards the officers went through the camp {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} and gave this order to the nation: \uc1\u8221*When you see the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord} your God being carried by the priestly Levites, then set out and follow it, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} so that you can learn the ford by which you are to cross, because you have never crossed here before. Only, you must not come close to the ark. Between it and you there must be a space kept of two thousand cubits.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} Then Joshua said to the people, \uc1\u8221*Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow, the {\scaps Lord} will do wonders among you.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} To the priests he said, \uc1\u8220*Lift the ark of the covenant and go in front of the people.\uc1\u8221* So they lifted the ark of the covenant and went in front of the people. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} And the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua, \uc1\u8221*This day I begin to exalt you in the sight of Israel, to let them see that as I was with Moses so I will be with you. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} Order the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant to stand still in the Jordan as soon as they reach the edge of the water. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} Then Joshua told the Israelites to come and listen to the words of the {\scaps Lord}, their God. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} Joshua said, \uc1\u8221*This is to let you see that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail evict before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing the Jordan in front of you. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, a man from each tribe. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} Whenever the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord}, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be stopped. The waters which are flowing down, they will be dammed up.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} And when the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, headed by the priests who carried the ark of the covenant, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} as soon as the bearers reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped in the water at the edge (for the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest), {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} the waters that flow down stopped and were dammed up at a distance, at Adam (a town beside Zarethan), while the waters that flow away to the sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea) were cut off and failed. In this way the people crossed, opposite Jericho. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord} stood still on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all Israel crossed on dry ground until the whole nation had finished crossing.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 4 }When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} \uc1\u8221*Take twelve men from the nation, a man from each tribe, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} and order them to take twelve stones out of the Jordan from the spot where the feet of the priests stood firm. They must carry these stones across and place them on the spot where you spend the night.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} Joshua called the twelve men of Israel whom he had ready, one from each of the tribes. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} and said to them, \uc1\u8221*Cross in front of the ark of the {\scaps Lord} your God through the Jordan, each of you taking a stone on his shoulder, one for each of the tribes of Israel. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} They are to be a sign for your nation. When in the future your children ask what is the meaning of these stones, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} tell them it was because the waters of the Jordan were stopped before the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord}, stopped when it crossed the Jordan. These stones will be a memorial for Israel for all time.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} The Israelites followed Joshua\uc1\u8217*s orders. They lifted twelve stones out of the Jordan, as the {\scaps Lord} had commanded Joshua, one for each of the tribes of Israel, and carried them over along with them to the spot where they spent the night, laying them down there. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} Joshua also had twelve stones set up in the middle of the Jordan on the spot where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. They are there to this day. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} For the priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until all was finished that Joshua was told by the {\scaps Lord} to enjoin upon the people, all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people hurried over, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark passed over, the priests advancing to the front of the people. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh passed across under arms in front of the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} about forty thousand men equipped for war, crossing under the eyes of the {\scaps Lord} to the plains of Jericho to fight. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} The {\scaps Lord} exalted Joshua that day in the eyes of all Israel. They stood in awe of him as they had stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} Then the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} \uc1\u8221*Order the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to step up from the Jordan.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} Joshua ordered the priests to step up from the Jordan, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} and whenever the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord} came up from the Jordan, whenever the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted on to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan flowed back into their place and overflowed their banks as before. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} It was on the tenth day of the first month that the people came up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern side of Jericho. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} The twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan were set up by Joshua at Gilgal. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} He said to the Israelites, \uc1\u8221*When in the future your children ask what these stones mean, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} tell your children that Israel crossed the Jordan here on dry ground, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} for the {\scaps Lord} your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had passed across, as the {\scaps Lord} your God had done to the Reed Sea, which he also dried up before us until we passed across it \uc1\u8211* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} to let all the nations on earth know how strong is the hand of the {\scaps Lord}, that they may stand in awe of the {\scaps Lord} your God for all time.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 5 }Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings by the Mediterranean heard how the {\scaps Lord} had dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites until they had got across, their hearts trembled and they were all dispirited, on account of the Israelites.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} It was then that the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua, \uc1\u8221*Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites once more.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at the Hill of Foreskins. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} Joshua circumcised them for this reason: all who had left Egypt, all the male warriors, had died during the journey through the desert after leaving Egypt. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} These who had left Egypt were circumcised, but none of the people who had been born in the desert after leaving Egypt had been circumcised. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} For forty years the Israelites had journeyed in the desert until the whole nation of warriors who had left Egypt had perished, because they would not listen to what the {\scaps Lord} said, and because the {\scaps Lord} had sworn to them that he would not let them see the land which the {\scaps Lord} had sworn to their ancestors that he would give us, a land abounding in milk and honey. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} So their children, whom the {\scaps Lord} raised up instead of them, were circumcised by Joshua, since they had not been circumcised on the journey. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} After the circumcising was over, the whole nation remained where they were in the camp until they had recovered. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} Then said the {\scaps Lord} to Joshua, \uc1\u8221*And now I have rolled off you the scorn of the Egyptians.\uc1\u8221* Hence the name of the spot was called Gilgal{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn   Gilgal sounds like the Hebrew for to roll }, and is so called to this day.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} When the Israelites were in camp at Gilgal they kept the passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, on the plains of Jericho. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} The day after the passover they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted grain. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} And that very day the manna ceased, once they ate the produce of the land. The Israelites no longer had manna, but ate hereafter the food of the land of Canaan. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} Joshua was one day near Jericho when he looked up and saw a man standing before him, holding a drawn sword. Joshua went up to him and said, \uc1\u8221*Are you for us, or are you for our enemies?\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} \uc1\u8221*Neither,\uc1\u8221* he answered, \uc1\u8221*I am here as the captain of the host of the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8221* Then Joshua fell on his face to the ground and worshipped, saying, \uc1\u8221*And what has my Lord to say to his servant?\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} The captain of the host of the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua, \uc1\u8221*Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is sacred.\uc1\u8221* Joshua did so.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 6 }Now Jericho had shut its gates against the Israelites. No one left the town, and no one entered it. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} Then the {\scaps Lord} said to Joshua, \uc1\u8220*I am putting Jericho into your hands, with its king and all its fighting men. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} For six days you and all your men at arms must march round the town once a day, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} with seven priests carrying seven rams\uc1\u8217* horns as trumpets in front of the ark. On the seventh day march round the town seven times, and the priests must blow a trumpet blast. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} As soon as they blow a long trumpet blast on the horns, when you hear the sound, then all the people must raise a mighty shout, and the wall of the town will fall down flat, until every man of you can march in, straight in front of him.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and told them to lift the ark of the covenant and let seven priests carry seven rams\uc1\u8217* horns as trumpets in front of the ark of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} Then he told the people, \uc1\u8220*Forward, march round the town, with the armed men in front of the ark of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} Let the seven priests with the trumpets of rams\uc1\u8217* horns go ahead in presence of the {\scaps Lord}, blowing the trumpets, and followed by the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} Let the armed men go in front of the priests who blow the trumpets, and let the rearguard follow the ark, the trumpets blowing.\uc1\u8217* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} To the people Joshua said, \uc1\u8220*You must not shout nor cry, you must not say a word, until I tell you to shout. Then shout.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} He had the ark of the {\scaps Lord} carried round the town, going round it once. Then all retired to the camp and passed the night there. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} Next morning Joshua rose, the priests lifted the ark of the {\scaps Lord}, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} and the seven priests carrying the seven rams\uc1\u8217* horns as trumpets kept on in front of the ark of the {\scaps Lord}, blowing a blast, preceded by the armed men, with the rearguard after the ark, the trumpets blowing as they went. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} On the second day they marched round the town once, and then retired to the camp. This they did for six days. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} On the seventh day they rose at dawn and marched round the town seven times. This was the only day they marched seven times round it. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} The seventh time, when the priests blew their blast, Joshua said to the people, \uc1\u8221*Shout, for the {\scaps Lord} has given you the town. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} It will be dedicated to the {\scaps Lord} by destruction, the town and all in it. Only Rahab the prostitute will be spared, she and all who are with her in her house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} As for you, hands off any of the spoil which has been dedicated, lest you desire it and take some of it! That would be the ruin and undoing of the camp of Israel. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} No, all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the {\scaps Lord} and must come to the treasury of the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} Then the people shouted, at the trumpet blast, and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet blast and raised a mighty shout, down the wall fell flat, until every man could march in, straight in front of him. In they marched and so they took the town, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} They massacred all in the city, men and women, old and young alike, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, giving no quarter. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the country, \uc1\u8221*Go to the prostitute\uc1\u8217*s house and fetch the woman out, with all she has, as you swore to her.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} So the young spies went and brought Rahab out, with her father and mother and brothers and all she had, all her family. They placed them outside the camp of Israel. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} The town and all in it they burned up. Only the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron they put into the treasury of the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25} Rahab the prostitute and her family and all she had, Joshua spared. She lived among the Israelites, as do her descendants to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26} Joshua then laid this oath upon the people:

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 7 }But the Israelites broke faith with regard to the spoil which had been dedicated. Achan the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, who belonged to the tribe of Judah, took some of it, and so the anger of the {\scaps Lord} blazed against the Israelites.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which lies close to Beth-aven on the east of Bethel, ordering them to go up and spy out the land. They went up and spied out Ai {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} and came back to Joshua, saying, \uc1\u8220*All the nation need not go up. Let only about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make all the nation toil up there, for there are few people at Ai.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} So about three thousand men marched up. But they ran away from the men of Ai. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and chased them from their gates as far as Shebarim, killing some others at the descent. The hearts of Israel trembled and became weak as water, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} and Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground upon his face before the ark of the {\scaps Lord} until evening, he and the elders of Israel, with dust upon their heads. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} \uc1\u8220*Ah, Lord {\scaps God},\uc1\u8221* said Joshua, \uc1\u8220*why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan, only to hand us over to the Amorites to be killed? Would that we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} O Lord, what can I say, after Israel has run away from its enemies? {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} The Canaanites and all who live in the land will hear of it and surround us and wipe us off the earth. Then what will you do for your great honour?\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} \uc1\u8220*Get up,\uc1\u8221* said the {\scaps Lord} to Joshua, \uc1\u8220*why are you lying on your face there? {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} Israel has sinned. They have broken my covenant which I commanded them to keep, they have taken some of the spoil which had been dedicated to me, stolen it, acted deceitfully, and hidden it among their own goods. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} That is why the Israelites cannot stand up against their enemies and why they run from their enemies, because they have brought themselves under the dedication by destruction! I will never be with you again, unless you remove everything from among you which was dedicated to me. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} Go and consecrate the people. Tell them to consecrate themselves for tomorrow. Tell them this from the {\scaps Lord} the God of Israel, There is a thing dedicated to me among you, O Israel. You cannot hold your own against your enemies until you put that thing away from you. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} So in the morning you will be brought before me by your tribes, and the tribe which the {\scaps Lord} takes by lot must come with its clans, and the clan which the {\scaps Lord} takes by lot must come with its families, and the men from the family which the {\scaps Lord} takes by lot must come one by one. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} Then he who is taken by lot, in possession of the object dedicated to me, must be killed, he and all his family, and their bodies burned, because he has broken the covenant of the {\scaps Lord}, because he has committed a scandal in Israel.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} In the morning Joshua rose and brought Israel before the {\scaps Lord} by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was taken by lot. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} Then the clans of Judah were brought, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken by lot. The clan of the Zerahites was brought, family by family, and the family of Zabdi was taken by lot. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} Then Zabdi brought his family man by man, and Achan the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, belonging to the tribe of Judah, was taken by lot. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} Joshua said to Achan, \uc1\u8221*My son, confess to the {\scaps Lord}, the God of Israel, own up to him. Tell me what you have done, do not hide it from me.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} Achan answered, \uc1\u8220*Truly I have sinned against the {\scaps Lord}, the God of Israel. This is what I did. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} When I saw among the spoil a splendid mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels in silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. The mantle is hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the money under it.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} So Joshua sent messengers, who ran to the tent, and there was the mantle hidden inside the tent, with the money under it! {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} They took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, who laid them before the {\scaps Lord}. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the mantle and the bar of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his donkeys and his sheep and his tent and all that he had. They brought them to the valley of Achor. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25} \uc1\u8220*Why have you undone us?\uc1\u8221* said Joshua. \uc1\u8220*The {\scaps Lord} will undo you this day.\uc1\u8221* Then all Israel stoned him and his family to death. They burned the bodies with fire and stoned them with stones, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26} and over them they raised a great cairn of stones. It stands there to this day. Then the {\scaps Lord} relented from his fierce anger. So the name of the place is called the Valley of Achor{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn   That is, Trouble } down to this day.

{\cf1\f1\fs22 8 }Then said the {\scaps Lord} to Joshua, \uc1\u8220*Don\uc1\u8217*t be afraid or dismayed. Take all the warriors with you and march up to Ai. I put into your hands the king of Ai with his people and his town and his country. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} Treat Ai and its king as you treated Jericho and its king, except that you may take the spoils and cattle in it for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the town to the west of it.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} So Joshua and all the warriors started off for Ai. Three thousand veterans Joshua picked out, and despatched them by night {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} with orders to \uc1\u8220*Lie in ambush to the west of the town at its rear. Do not go too far away, but be all ready. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} I and all the troops who are with me will move against the town, and when they come out against us, as before, we will run off, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} until we draw them away from the town, for they will think we are running from them as before. Then, as we run away, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} you must start out of your ambush and seize the town. The {\scaps Lord} your God will put it into your hands. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} As soon as you have seized the town, set it on fire, and carry out the {\scaps Lord}\uc1\u8217*s command. These are my orders.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} So Joshua despatched them, and they went to the place of ambush, remaining between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. Joshua spent the night in the camp in the valley.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} Joshua rose in the morning and mustered the nation. Then he and the elders of Israel led them against Ai. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} All the nation, that is, the armed men who were with him, marched up close to the town and camped on the north of Ai. Between him and Ai lay a valley, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} so Joshua took about five thousand men and put them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the town. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} The main army were thus stationed to the north of the town, with the ambush laid to the west. Joshua passed that night in the middle of the valley. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} When the king of Ai saw this, he and his men made an early start. In the morning they rose and marched out to fight Israel at the expected place near the Arabah, not knowing that an ambush had been laid behind the town. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} They beat Joshua and all Israel, who fled in the direction of the desert. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} All the townsmen of Ai were called out to pursue them. They allowed themselves to be drawn away from the town. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, and in their pursuit of the Israelites they left the town unguarded. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} Then said the {\scaps Lord} to Joshua, \uc1\u8220*Stretch out the javelin in your hand towards Ai, for I put Ai in your power.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} And as soon as Joshua stretched out the javelin towards the town, the men in ambush rushed into the town and captured it, and hurried to set the town on fire. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} So that when the men of Ai turned round to look, there was smoke rising from the town! They had no chance to flee this way or that, for the Israelites who were flying towards the desert turned upon their pursuers. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} Seeing that the men in ambush had captured the town and seeing the smoke rise up from it, Joshua and the Iraelites turned and attacked the men of Ai, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} and the men in ambush rushed from the town to join them, so that the men of Ai were caught between Israelites, some on one side and some on the other. They were slaughtered until not a man escaped or remained alive. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} The king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
 {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} When the Israelite had finished slaughtering the townsmen of Ai who had run into the desert and when they had cut them down, giving no quarter, all Israel then returned to Ai and sacked it. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25} All the population of Ai fell that day, both men and women, twelve thousand in all. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26} Joshua never withdrew the hand that held his javelin until he had massacred all who lived in Ai. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27} Only the Israelites took the spoils and cattle of the town for themselves, as the {\scaps Lord} had given orders to Joshua. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28} Ai itself Joshua burned, and made it a heap of ruins. To this day it lies desolate. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29} Joshua hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening. At sunset Joshua ordered his body to be taken down from the tree and thrown down at the entrance to the town-gate. They raised a cairn of stones over it, which is there to this day. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30} Then Joshua built an altar to the {\scaps Lord}, the God of Israel, on mount Ebal, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 31} as Moses the servant of the {\scaps Lord} had commanded the Israelites, according to the directions written in the law book of Moses. It was an altar of undressed stones, to which no man had ever taken an iron tool. They sacrificed burnt-offerings to the {\scaps Lord} upon it, and recompense offerings. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 32} Also he wrote on the stones there a copy of the law of Moses, writing it in presence of the Israelites. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 33} All Israel, both native Israelites and foreigners, with their elders, their officials, and their judges, stood on each side of the ark in presence of the priestly Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the {\scaps Lord}. Half of them stood in front of mount Gerizim and half in front of mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the {\scaps Lord} had previously commanded the people to be blessed. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 34} Then Joshua read aloud all the terms of the law, the blessing and the curse, exactly as it was written in the law book. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 35} There was not a word of the orders of Moses which Joshua did not read aloud before all the assembled Israelites, with the women, the children, and the foreigners who accompanied them.

{\cf1\f1\fs22 9 }When this was heard by all the kings west of the Jordan, in the highlands and the lowlands and all along the coast of the Mediterranean as far as Lebanon, then Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} gathered as one to attack Joshua and Israel. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} When the citizens of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} they went to work craftily. They took provisions in old sacks on their donkeys, and old mended wineskins, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} with old patched sandals on their feet and old clothes on their bodies. The bread they took was all dry and crumbling. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} They went to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and to the Israelites, \uc1\u8220*We have come from a far country. Please make a treaty with us.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} \uc1\u8216*The Israelites said to these Hivites, \uc1\u8220*Perhaps you live in our country, so why should we make a treaty with you?\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} \uc1\u8220*We are at your service,\uc1\u8221* they said to Joshua. \uc1\u8220*But who are you,\uc1\u8221* Joshua asked, \uc1\u8220*and where do you come from?\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} \uc1\u8220*From a country very far away,\uc1\u8221* they said, \uc1\u8220*and we have come on account of the {\scaps Lord}, your God, for we have heard of his fame, of all he did in Egypt, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} and of all he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan, king Sihon of Heshbon and king Og of Bashan who reigned at Ashtaroth. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} Our elders and all our people told us to take provisions with us for the journey and to go and meet you and say, \uc1\u8216*We are at your service. Please make a treaty with us.\uc1\u8217* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} This bread we took hot out of our houses on the day we started, and there, you see, it is dry and crumbling by this time! {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} These wineskins were new when we filled them, and you see they are torn. These clothes and shoes of ours are worn out, owing to the long journey.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} So the Israelites tried some of their provisions, never asking the {\scaps Lord} for advice. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} Joshua made peace with them and made a treaty with them to spare their lives, and the leaders of the community swore an oath to them. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} Three days after they had made the treaty, they heard that the men were neighbours, living in the same country! {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} On the third day, as the Israelites marched forward, they came to their towns, Gibeon, Kefirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} The Israelites did not kill them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them by the {\scaps Lord}, the God of Israel. The community all grumbled against the leaders, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} but the leaders all replied, \uc1\u8220*We swore an oath to them by the {\scaps Lord} the God of Israel! We cannot now touch them. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} We must grant them the favour of their lives, or wrath will come upon us over the oath we took to them. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} Let them live,\uc1\u8221* said the leaders. So they became woodcutters and watercarriers to all the community, as the leaders directed. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} Then Joshua called for them and asked them, \uc1\u8220*Why have you deceived us by saying you came from far, far away, when you live in the same country as ourselves? {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} A curse on you! You will forever provide us with slaves for the temple of my God, woodcutters and watercarriers.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} They answered Joshua, \uc1\u8220*It was because we, your servants, were assured that the {\scaps Lord} your God had ordered his servant Moses to assign you all the land and to destroy all the people living in it. That put us in terror of our lives before you, and so we did this. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25} Well, we are in your power! Whatever you think right and fair to do to us, do it.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26} This then, was how Joshua treated them: he saved them from the Israelites and kept them from being murdered, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27} but he made them that day woodcutters and watercarriers for the community and for the altar of the {\scaps Lord}, wherever the {\scaps Lord} chooses.

For Gibeon was a large town, like a royal city, larger than Ai, and all its men were stout fighters. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent to Hoham the king of Hebron, to Piram the king of Jarmuth, to Japhia the king of Lachish, and to Debir the king of Eglon, saying, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} \uc1\u8220*Join me and help me to storm Gibeon, for it has made terms with Joshua and the Israelites.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} So the five Amorite kings \uc1\u8211* the king of Jerusalem and the king of Hebron and the king of Jarmuth and the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon \uc1\u8211* all mustered and marched up with all their armies to besiege Gibeon and attack it. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, telling him, \uc1\u8220*Don\uc1\u8217*t abandon your servants!

And no one from that area dared say a word against any of the Israelites. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} Then Joshua ordered the mouth of the cave to be opened and the five kings brought out to him. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} This was done. The five kings were brought out, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} When these kings had been brought before Joshua, he called for all the men of Israel and told the army commanders present to come forward and put their feet on the necks of the kings.

You will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} Joshua and all his troops made a sudden attack upon them beside the waters of Merom. They made an onset, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} and the {\scaps Lord} put them into the hands of Israel, who routed them, chasing them to Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh eastward. They routed them and left not one alive. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} Joshua treated them as the {\scaps Lord} instucted him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} Joshua then wheeled round and captured Hazor, cutting down the king of the place (for Hazor was formerly the most powerful of these realms). {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} They massacred everyone in the place, wiping them out, until not a living person was left, and Hazor was burned to the ground. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} All the towns of these kings and all the kings themselves Joshua captured and massacred, wiping them all out, as Moses the servant of the {\scaps Lord} had ordered. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} (Towns standing on their own mounds of earth, however, the Israelites did not burn, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned.) {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} All the spoil and cattle of these towns the Israelites took for themselves. But they massacred all the people until they were wiped out, and not a living person was left. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} As the {\scaps Lord} had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses had commanded Joshua, and Joshua obeyed. Of all that the {\scaps Lord} had commanded Moses, Joshua left not a thing undone. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} In this way Joshua captured all that country, the highlands, all the Negeb, all the land of Goshen, the lowlands, the Arabah, the highlands and the lowlands of Israel, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} from Mount Halak that rises to Seir, as far as to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all the kings and put them to death. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} Joshua was a long time warring with all these kings. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} Not a single town would make peace with the Israelites, except the Hivites who inhabited Gibeon. All the rest had to be captured by fighting. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} It was the {\scaps Lord} who made their hearts stubborn enough to battle with Israel, so they were all wiped out, destroyed without mercy as the {\scaps Lord} had commanded Moses. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} It was then that Joshua went and wiped out the Anakim from the hills, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the highlands of Israel and of Judah. Joshua massacred them and sacked their towns. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} None of the Anakim was left in the land of Israel. It was only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod, that some still lived. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} In this way Joshua captured the whole country, as the {\scaps Lord} had told Moses. Joshua assigned it to the tribes of Israel by their divisions as their own property. And so the land had rest from war.

So, as the {\scaps Lord} had ordered, Joshua gave them an inheritance among the relatives of their father. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} Ten shares fell to Manasseh, apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan on the east of the Jordan {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} (because the daughters of Manasseh inherited along with their male relatives, and the rest of the descendents of Manasseh held the land of Gilead). {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} The frontier of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethah east of Shechem, then south to the people living in En-tappuah {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} (the land of Tappuah belonging to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the frontier of Manasseh belonging to Ephraim). {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} The frontier went down to the south of the Kanah Valley these towns belonged to Ephraim among the towns of Manasseh, then ran along the north side of the valley as far as the sea, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} the land to the south being Ephraim\uc1\u8217*s and the land to the north belonging to Manasseh, with the sea as the frontier to the west. They stretched to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} In Issachar and Asher Manasseh held Beth-shean and its townships, Ibleam and its townships, the people living in Dor and its townships (the three heights of Dor), the people living in En-dor and its townships, the people living in Taanach and its townships, the people living in Megiddo and its townships{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn   Heb. uncertain. }. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} But the Manassites could not evict the people of these towns.

{\cf1\f1\fs22 24 }Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, summoning the elders of Israel and their leaders, their judges, and their officers. They presented themselves before God, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2} and Joshua said to all the people, \uc1\u8221*This is the message of the {\scaps Lord} the God of Israel: In days of old your ancestors lived east of the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, worshipping other gods. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3} But I took your ancestor Abraham from the other side of the Euphrates, I led him through all the land of Canaan, multiplying his family, and giving him Isaac. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4} To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave Mount Seir as his holding, while Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5} Later I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with wonders which I wrought among them. Afterwards I brought you out, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6} I brought out your ancestors from Egypt, and when you reached the sea the Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and cavalry as far as the Reed Sea. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7} But when your ancestors cried to the {\scaps Lord}, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea over them. You saw with your own eyes what I did in Egypt. You lived many days in the desert, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8} but I brought you to the land of the Amorites on the eastern side of the Jordan, and when they fought you I put them into your hands and you occupied their land, until I destroyed them before you. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9} Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, made an attack upon Israel. He sent for Balaam the son of Beer to curse you, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10} but I would not listen to Balaam. He had to bless you instead, and so I saved you from him. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11} You crossed the Jordan and reached Jericho, where the men of Jericho fought you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I put them all into your hands. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12} I sent panic{\super\chftn}{\footnote\pard\plain\chftn  Heb. uncertain. Often rendered \uc1\u8217*the hornet\uc1\u8217* } before you to drive out these nations, even the two kings of the Amorites. It was not your sword nor your bow that beat them. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13} I gave you a land on which you had never laboured, you live in towns you never built, and you now eat from vineyards and oliveyards that you never planted. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14} So revere the {\scaps Lord} and serve him honestly and loyally, put away the gods your ancestors served on the east of the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the {\scaps Lord} yourselves. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15} If you are unwilling to serve the {\scaps Lord}, then choose today whom you will serve, either the gods your ancestors served on the east of the Euphrates or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16} The people replied, \uc1\u8220*Far be it from us to forsake the {\scaps Lord} and serve other gods! {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17} It is the {\scaps Lord} our God who has brought us and our ancestors out of the land of Egypt, out of that slave-pen, who wrought these great portents before our eyes, who preserved us wherever we went and among all the nations through whom we passed. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18} The {\scaps Lord} drove out all the nations before us, all the Amorites who lived in the land. So we will serve the {\scaps Lord}, for he is our God.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19} Joshua said to the people, \uc1\u8220*You may not be able to serve the {\scaps Lord}. He is a holy God, a jealous God, he will not forgive any sinful disloyalty of yours. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20} If you forsake the {\scaps Lord} and serve foreign gods, he will turn to do evil to you and consume you after he has been doing you good.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21} \uc1\u8220*No,\uc1\u8221* said the people, \uc1\u8220*we will serve the {\scaps Lord}.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22} So Joshua said to the people, \uc1\u8220*You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the {\scaps Lord} to serve him.\uc1\u8221* \uc1\u8220*Yes, we are!\uc1\u8221* they responded. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23} \uc1\u8220*Then here and now,\uc1\u8221* he said, \uc1\u8220*put away the foreign gods which are among you and give your hearts to the {\scaps Lord} the God of Israel.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24} The people answered, \uc1\u8220*The {\scaps Lord} our God will we serve, and we will listen to his voice.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25} So Joshua made a covenant that day with the people, fixing rules and laws for them at Shechem. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26} Joshua wrote these terms in the law book of God. He took a large boulder and set it up there under the sacred oak in the sanctuary of the {\scaps Lord}, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27} saying to all the people, \uc1\u8220*This stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all that the {\scaps Lord} has said to us. So will it be a witness against you, lest you deny your God.\uc1\u8221* {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28} Then Joshua sent the people away home, every man to his own inheritance. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29} After this Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the {\scaps Lord}, died, at the age of a hundred and ten. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30} They buried him in his own estate at Timnath-serah in the highlands of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
